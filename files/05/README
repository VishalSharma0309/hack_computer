Assembler - 

    A Python program which receives an asm file as a command line argument,
    and saves a .hack file (with the same base filename) which contains the compiled
    hack binary program.

    Performs three passes over the program:

    The first pass 'cleans' the program - i.e removes comments, empty lines and
    unneeded spaces, so that the rest of the compilation process works on a list of pure
    asm commands.

    The second pass extracts the label symbols from the program,
    and updates the program's symbol table.

    The third pass iterates over all the program's non-label line, and compiles them into
    the needed Hack binary codes, and uses the symbols extracted in the second pass.

    Most of the commands were explicitly translated according to the bit sequences
    specified in Chapter 6, using a simple python dictionary.

Makefile - Only changes permissions to the assembler so it can run properly.
