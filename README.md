# 'Hack' Computer

### Objective
To build a computer from the absoulte basic logic gate NAND. 

### Technical Specification of 'Hack'




### General Architechture of 'Hack'



### Setting Up

#### Simulation Tools

### Hardware Description Language (HDL)

* HDL is a **functional/declarative** language 
* Order of HDL statements is **insignificant**
* Only prerequisite to use a build-in/user-defined chip is the knowledge of its **interface**

An HDL definition of a chip consists of a **header section** and a **parts section**. 

<br>

The **header section** specifies the chip interface, namely the chip name and the names of its input and output pins. 

<br>

The **parts section** describes the names and topology of all the lower-level parts (other chips) from which this chip is constructed. Each part is represented by a statement that specifies the part name and the way it is connected to other parts in the design.

#### Testing

1. Manual Testing

2. Script Testing

The script lists a series of testing scenarios, designed to simulate the various contingencies under which the chip will have to operate in ‘‘real-life’’ situations.

<br>

The script instructs the simulator to bind the chip inputs to certain data values, compute the resulting output, and record the test results in a designated output file.
